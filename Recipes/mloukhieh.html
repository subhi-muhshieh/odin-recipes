    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, work on the preperation of the chicken. Add the chicken breast to a pot and season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and ground coriander. </li>
        <li>Cover the chicken enitely with warm water. Add the onion, bay leaves, and garlic cloves. Let this come to a boil then bring to a simmer for about 20-25 minutes until fully cooked through. </li>
        <li>Once chicken is cooked, take it out and let it cool for a few minutes then shred with your hands or a fork.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth and set aside to use.</li>
        <li>Add the frozen mlokhia to a pot and add 1.5 cups of broth to this. Season with a bit of salt. Allow to simmer for 10 minutes. The minced mlokhia will melt into the stock creating the stew. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the salsa. In a mini food processor, blend the jalapeno, lemon juice, garlic, pinch of salt and olive oil. Adjust to taste.</li>
        <li>Saute the freshly minced garlic cloves in the olive oil until fragrant and crisp. Add this to the mlokhia.</li>
        <li>Add in the shredded chicken as well; warm together for a minutes then serve on a bed of rice with the salsa and lemon wedges. </li>
